# Bixal Presentation Template

The purpose of this project is to enable Bixalers to create presentation content using a webpage instead of tools like Google Slides or PowerPoint.

**[View templates and example content](https://bixal.github.io/presentation-template/)**

Why would you want to do this? Here are a few reasons:

- Inherently more accessible and responsive
- Robust version control and collaboration tools with GitHub
